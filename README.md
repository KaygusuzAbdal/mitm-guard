# MITM Guard

A usefull ethical hacking tool to detect MITM attacks. You can use it in public areas that serve free wifi. The MITM Guard will confuse the attacker by sending fake HTTP Requests.

## Usage

1. It's quite simple to use. Just start the program with calling the `mitm-guard.py` file as in the example command below.
```
python3 mitm-guard.py
```

The MITM Guard will find your public IP address and scan for same MAC addresses in the ARP table. Don't worry when it detects an attack, fake ARP packets will already be sent.
